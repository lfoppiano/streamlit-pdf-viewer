# streamlit-pdf-viewer

Streamlit component that allows the visualisation and enrichment of PDF documents.
You can see an [application](https://github.com/lfoppiano/structure-vision) in
action [here](https://structure-vision.streamlit.app/).

## Features

- Show PDF files in a Streamlit application with a simple command
- Based on the pdf.js library
- Visualize annotations on top of the PDF documents
- Render text on top of the PDF document, allowing copy-paste
- Allow rendering specific pages of the PDF document
- Scroll to a specific page
- Scroll to a specific annotation
- Allow custom callbacks when an annotation is clicked
- Interactive zoom controls with multiple zoom options
- Configurable alignment of the PDF viewer within its container
- Optional horizontal separators between PDF pages
- Additional support showing PDF documents using the native pdf.js browser's viewer: "legacy" (with limitations, no
  annotations, no scrolling, etc.)

## Limitations

- Tested and developed to support Firefox and Chrome.
- The legacy visualization works only on Firefox and does not support annotations
- This is a side project, so all troubleshooting may take time 
- The component is still in development, so expect some bugs and limitations
- The streamlit reload at each action may render slowly for complex PDF documents
- Removed support showing PDF documents using the native pdf.js browser's viewer.

## Caveats

Here are some caveats to be aware of:

- It is mandatory to specify a `width` to show PDF document on tabs and expanders, otherwise, the viewer will not be
  displayed on tabs not immediately visible.
- From version 0.0.16, the behavior for managing width and height has changed:
    - If only the height is specified, the PDF document will be shown in proportion with the with proportional based on
      the PDF dimensions.
    - The possibility to show a large view of half the PDF is not available anymore (let's face it, it was not very
      useful).
    - If you need to use all the available space and limit the height, you can encapsulate the `pdf_viewer()` into a
      `st.component(width:...)` setting the width.
- The `legacy` rendering has been removed from version 0.1.x+
## Getting started

```sh
pip install streamlit-pdf-viewer
```

In your streamlit application, you can use it as:

```python
import streamlit as st
from streamlit_pdf_viewer import pdf_viewer

pdf_viewer("str, path or bytes")
```

You can also customize the viewer with additional options:

```python
import streamlit as st
from streamlit_pdf_viewer import pdf_viewer

# Display PDF with custom zoom, alignment, and separators
pdf_viewer(
    "path/to/your/document.pdf",
    width=700,
    height=1000,
    zoom_level=1.2,                    # 120% zoom
    viewer_align="center",             # Center alignment
    show_page_separator=True           # Show separators between pages
)
```

| render_text             | Enable a layer of text on top of the PDF document. The text may be selected and copied. **NOTE** to avoid breaking existing deployments, we made this optional at first, also considering that having many annotations might interfere with the copy-paste.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| zoom_level              | The zoom level of the PDF viewer. Can be a float (0.1-10.0), `"auto"` for fit-to-width, `"auto-height"` for fit-to-height, or `None` (defaults to auto-fit to width). When zoom controls are enabled, users can interactively adjust the zoom level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| viewer_align            | The alignment of the PDF viewer within its container. Can be `"center"` (default), `"left"`, or `"right"`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| show_page_separator     | Whether to show a horizontal separator line between PDF pages. Defaults to `True`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| scroll_to_page          | Scroll to a specific page when the component is rendered. The parameter is an integer, which represent the positional value of the page. E.g. 1, will be the first page. Default is None. Require ints and ignores the parameters below zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| scroll_to_annotation    | Scroll to a specific annotation when the component is rendered. The parameter is an integer, which represent the positional value of the annotation. E.g. 1, will be the first annotation. Default is None (don't scroll). Mutually exclusive with `scroll_to_page`. Raise an exception if used with `scroll_to_page`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| on_annotation_click     | Callback function that is called when an annotation is clicked. The function receives the annotation as a parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

### Annotation format

The annotation format has been derived from the [Grobid's coordinate formats](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Coordinates-in-PDF/), which are described as a list of "bounding boxes".
The annotations are expressed as a dictionary of six elements; the page, x and y indicate the top left point. 
The `color` can be expressed following the HTML CSS convention. 
The `border` style also follow the HTML conventions limited to these values: `solid`, `dashed`, `dotted`, `double`, `groove`, `ridge`, `inset`, `outset`. 
Any other value will result in the default value: `solid`.

Annotation unique identifiers are expressed by the `id` field, if `id` is not specified, an identifier will be generated during rendering. 
Furthermore, the HTML identifier will be generated as `#annotation-{annotation.id}`. 

Here is an example:

```json
[
  {
    "page": 1,
    "x": 220,
    "y": 155,
    "height": 22,
    "width": 65,
    "color": "red",
    "border": "solid"
  },
[...]
```



The example shown in our screenshot can be found [here](resources/annotations.json).

### Custom callback for clicking on annotations

```python
from streamlit_pdf_viewer import pdf_viewer

annotations = [
    {
        "page": 1,
        "x": 220,
        "y": 155,
        "height": 22,
        "width": 65,
        "color": "red"
    },
    {
        "page": 1,
        "x": 220,
        "y": 155,
        "height": 22,
        "width": 65,
        "color": "red",
        "border": "dotted"
    }
]


def my_custom_annotation_handler(annotation):
    print(f"Annotation {annotation} clicked.")


pdf_viewer(
    "path/to/pdf",
    on_annotation_click=my_custom_annotation_handler,
    annotations=annotations
)

```

## Developers notes

### Environment

- Python >= 3.8
- Node.js >= 16
- Streamlit >= 1.28.2

### Configure environment for development

First, make sure that _RELEASE = False in `streamlit_pdf_viewer/__init__.py`. To run the component in development mode,
use the following commands:

```shell
streamlit run streamlit_pdf_viewer/__init__.py

cd frontend
npm run serve
```

These commands will start the Streamlit application and serve the Node.js component. Please make sure you're in the
correct directory before running these commands.

### Integrate into a streamlit application

1. Build the frontend part:

    ```shell
    cd frontend
    export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
    npm run build 
    ```

2. Make sure that _RELEASE = True in `streamlit_pdf_viewer/__init__.py`.

3. move to the streamlit_application and run

    ```shell
    pip install -e {path of component}
    ```

### Release

```shell 
bump-my-version bump patch | minor | major
```

```shell
git push
git push --tags 
```
